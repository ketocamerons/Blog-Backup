# Instructions
1. Heat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Melt butter on the stove and gradually add cocoa powder stirring continually. Once melted, make sure everything is mixed well and turn off the heat.
3. Add eggs, erythritol and then all the other ingredients and mix very well. Preferably sift the almond meal and flax so there are no lumps. The mixture will be creamy.
4. Spray oil into a square or round tray (I used round about 8" diam). Pour mixture in and bake for approx 20 mins for soft and chewy brownies. Bake few mins more for more drier brownies. Cut into wedges or squares.
