# Ingredients
- 1 tbsp butter/MCT oil
- 1 tbsp powdered Swerve Sweetener

# Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 325F.
2. In a small ramekin, melt butter in microwave. 
3. Stir in powdered sweetener until well combined. 
4. Stir in egg whites and vanilla extract.
5. Stir in almond flour, cocoa powder and baking powder, then add water and stir until mixture is smooth. Sprinkle the top with chocolate chips.
5. Bake 12 to 18 minutes (less for gooey, more for cakey). This will also depend on how shallow or deep your ramekin is.
6. Let cool a few minutes and then top with whipped cream or low carb ice cream for a delicious treat!
