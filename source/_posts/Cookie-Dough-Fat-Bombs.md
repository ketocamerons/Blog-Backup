These are a great easy snack when you need a sweet hit. They do need to be kept in the freezer, but it's worth it in my book. The original recipe can be found [here](https://www.healthfulpursuit.com/2016/03/keto-easter-egg-cookie-dough-fat-bombs/?utm_source=Healthful+Pursuit+Newsletter&utm_campaign=ebd4478277-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_01_03&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_590b00b5b3-ebd4478277-59325985&mc_cid=ebd4478277&mc_eid=bdfb84fb12) (shaped as eggs for Easter).

# Ingredients:

- 2 cups (235 grams) almond meal/flour

- ½ cup (100 grams) coconut oil, melted

- 1 teaspoon (5ml) vanilla extract

- 5-10 drops stevia

- ¼ teaspoon (1 gram) salt

- ⅓ cup (70g grams) sugar-free dark chocolate chips

# Instructions

1. Lay parchment paper or a silicon baking mat over a large baking sheet.
2. Add almond flour, coconut oil, vanilla, stevia, and salt to your food processor with an “S” blade. Process until smooth, about 20 seconds. (If you don't have a food processor, mix together. The texture won't be as smooth, but they'll still taste great!)
3. Fold in chocolate chips. Scoop about 1.5 tablespoons and roll into a ball between your palms. Place on prepared lined baking sheet and flatten, shaping into a large egg. Continue with remaining dough.
4. Transfer baking sheet to the freezer and chill for 1-hour.
9. Keep stored in the fridge in a sealed container for up to 5 days. Can be frozen and enjoyed for 1-month.
