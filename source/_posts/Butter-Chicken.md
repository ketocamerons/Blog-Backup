This doesn't taste exactly like your average butter chicken, but in my estimation it might be even better. The original recipe can be found [here](https://www.ketoconnect.net/recipe/keto-butter-chicken/).

# Ingredients
- 1 lb chicken breast
- 1  cup heavy whipping cream 
- 2 tbsp butter 
- 1.5 tbsp tomato paste
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1/4 medium onion

# Instructions
1. Cut the chicken up into bite sized chunks and generously coat them in the turmeric, ginger, salt, chili powder and cinnamon. Set aside in a bowl.
2. Heat a skillet to medium heat and add the butter. As the butter melts dice the onion and garlic and add it to the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes until the onions are translucent and fragrant.
3. Increase the pan heat to medium-high and add the chicken. Cook it almost entirely through - the outside should be white and this will take about 3-5 minutes.
4. Once the chicken looks almost fully cooked add in the heavy whipping cream and tomato paste. Using a spatula mix in the tomato paste so it runs smooth through the heavy whipping cream. It should be an orange color at this point. 
5. Turn the heat to medium-low and cover with a lid for 5-7 minutes.
5. Remove lid and combine. The chicken is fully cooked and you should be able to eat it. However, if you like a thicker curry sauce allow it to reduce with the lid off until it reaches the consistency you like.
6. Serve with low carb naan or over cauliflower rice. Enjoy!

### Note
You can store the butter chicken in a sealed container for up to 10 days in the fridge and 2 months in the freezer. You can also use chicken thighs instead of breast for a higher fat content.
