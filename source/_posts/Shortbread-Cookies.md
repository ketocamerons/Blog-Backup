# Instructions
*Before making this recipe, make sure to MEASURE all of the ingredients.  It WILL affect the cookie dough if it's not the exact measurements.*
1. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F.
2. In a stand mixer with the dough hook attached, add the cold butter, almond flour, oat fiber, erythritol, stevia and sea salt.
3. Start the stand mixer (or food processor/strong hand mixer) on the lowest setting and mix for a couple of minutes until it forms a dough.
4. With your hands, grab the dough and form a ball.  Place the ball on top of a parchment paper, place another piece of parchment paper over the ball and press down. 
5. With a rolling pin, roll into a 0.3-0.4 inch/0.8-1cm thick disk. Cut into small bricks or cut using biscuit cutters, a knife or a pizza cutter.  You should be able to make 40 cookies.  
6. With a dough scraper, lift up each cookie and place onto the baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake for 12-15 minutes until golden brown.
7. Take out of the oven and let cool completely.  This will solidify the cookies.
8. Once the cookies are cooled, you can dip them in chocolate.  In a small bowl, add the chocolate chips and coconut oil and microwave 40ish seconds until melted.  Stir with a spatula to make sure all of the chocolate has melted properly.  Dip each cookie into the chocolate halfway (or whatever design you want) and place each dipped cookie back onto the parchment paper.  
9. If it's winter you can leave the cookies onto the counter as the chocolate shouldn't melt, but in summer, store the cookies into the fridge as the chocolate will melt off.

### Notes
*You can use palm shortening for a dairy-free version.
**For paleo, switch the oat fiber to arrowroot or tapioca flour.  
***For paleo, switch the erythritol to a sweetener of your choice.
