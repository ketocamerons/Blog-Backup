I made this in a pinch, looking for recipe ideas that don't require an oven or stovetop, and it definitely came through. The original recipe can be found [here](https://kalynskitchen.com/recipe-for-crunchy-napa-cabbage-asian/).

# Instructions

1. Thinly slice Napa cabbage, then coarsely chop to make 3-4 cups shredded cabbage. Trim both ends of sugar snap peas, then thinly slice on the diagonal to make 1 cup sliced peas. Slice green onions to make 1/2 cup.  If using cilantro, wash, spin dry or dry with paper towels, and then chop enough to make 1/2 – 3/4 cup chopped cilantro.  
2. Put Napa cabbage, sugar snap peas, radishes, green onions (and cilantro if using) into salad bowl.
3. In a bowl or glass measuring cup stir together the white wine vinegar, Splenda or sugar, soy sauce, garlic puree, sesame oil, ginger puree, and Sriracha sauce.  Whisk in the mayo until ingredients are well combined.
4. Toss salad ingredients, add enough dressing to coat ingredients, and toss again. 
5. Toast the sliced almonds in a dry pan over high heat for 1-2 minutes (just until the nuts are fragrant).  Add almonds and toss.
