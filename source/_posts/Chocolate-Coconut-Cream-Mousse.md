This one is an overnighter, so don't wait until the day you want to serve it. Throw some cans of coconut milk in your fridge the night beforehand.

# Ingredients
- 1 can full fat coconut milk (NOT the one you use in cocktails)

# Instructions
1. Refrigerate the can for a few hours or overnight and once it is well chilled, scoop out the cream that has set up at the top BUT don’t throw the liquid out…reserve this to use in your cooking or baking, it’s delicious in pancakes. 
2. Place the solid cream in the bowl of your stand mixer, add your favorite sweetener,vanilla and a good quality cocoa powder and whip it up. 

This is so delicious and believe it or not, one can is enough for two people! It makes a great mousse to top with your favorite fruits or some dark chocolate coco nibs for some crunch.
