Another Christmas hit that I would definitely recommend trying for yourself. However, if you use a water bath, don't use a leaky springform tin like I did, unless you want a soggy base. The original can be found [here](https://www.fatforweightloss.com.au/recipe/new-york-baked-cheesecake/).

# Instructions
1. Add all the base ingredients into a bowl, melt the butter in the microwave for 30 seconds and mix together in a bowl.
2. In a cake tin, line the inside with baking paper and press the base mixture into the bottom of the tin. 
3. Place the tin in the fridge and continue to follow the steps. Turn the oven on and select 140 degrees C (280 F) if fan forced, otherwise 160 degrees (320 F).
4. In a mixing bowl, add the cream cheese and the sour cream together, along with the vanilla essence and the lemon zest. 
5. Add 1 Egg to the bowl and begin to mix together (I use electric beaters to get a good consistency). 
6. As the mixture begins to mix slightly, add another egg and continue to mix. Add the last egg and continue to mix.
7. Take the base out of the fridge and fill the tin with the cheese mixture. Put into the oven and bake in a water bath (Or large ramekin filled with water in the oven beside cake) for 45 - 50 mins.
8. Check the cheesecake by pushing a spike into the middle. If it comes out clean then the cake is ready. Leave the oven slight open and leave the cake in the oven for another 30 mins to cool slowly. 
9. Put in the fridge for another 60 mins and enjoy!
