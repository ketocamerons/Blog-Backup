These chips are great for dipping into hommus or guacamole. Depending on the pepperoni you use, they might not be super crispy, but give it a shot!

# Instructions 
1. Layer two paper towels and place as many pepperonis on top of it as desired, making sure they don't overlap. Cover with an additional paper towel.
2. Microwave the pepperonis until they are stiff and crispy, usually no more than 1 minute.
3. Repeat the entire process for additional pepperoni chips. Serve with low carb dip or even my favorite, salsa!
