Some sort of preamble about Almond Joy Bars. Recipe is from [here](www.google.com).

# Ingredients
## Chocolate / Carob Base:
- ½ cup coconut oil (palm shortening would work well too, as well as butter)
- ½ cup almond butter (any nut or seed butter would work, but almond is especially nice) See Homemade Nut / Seed Butter. Use coconut butter for AIP. Here's how to make your own.
- ¼ cup granulated sweetener or appropriate substitute (for candida diets, xylitol and erythritol work well. 4-6 scoops stevia extract is a good alternative)
- 6 Tbsp cocoa (for more health benefits, use raw cacao, or use carob for AIP)
- 3 Tbsp additional sweetetner (I use vegetable glycerine, xylitol, erythritol, or any combination thereof, due to being on a candida diet, which I started a number of years ago. Use a little more if using erythritol since it isn't as sweet. You could use my DIY Truvia or 1½ scoops stevia as well)
- 1 tsp vanilla

## Coconut Topping:
- 1⅔ cup unsweetened coconut flakes
- 7 Tbsp coconut oil (palm shortening or butter would work well too)
- ⅓ cup granulated sweetener (or 2-3 scoops stevia extract powder. I use NuNaturals.)
- 1½ tsp vanilla
- ¼ tsp additional flavoring (optional. Almond or coconut are good choices)
- 2 tsp arrowroot powder (non-gmo cornstarch may be substituted. Use 1/16 tsp of xanthan gum or glucomannan if you need to avoid these foods.)
- Almond halves or slices (optional)

# Instructions
## Base:
1. Melt oil and nut / seed butter over low heat.
2. Stir in cocoa/carob (sifted if you like, but I have never bothered with this) and granulated sweetener and combine thoroughly.
3. Mix in remaining ingredients except for vanilla. Continuously stir until it slightly thickens, then remove from heat.
4. Stir in the vanilla.
5. Pour the mixture into an 8×8 pan and place in freezer to harden while you make the topping. If you don't have room in your freezer, the fridge will get it solid enough to work with.

## Topping:
1. Melt oil in small pan and add coconut flakes. Stir.
2. Add remaining ingredients. Simmer and stir until it thickens a bit.
3. Once the chocolate is hardened, gently smooth the coconut mixture on top.
4. Place slivered or whole almonds on top. Place bars back in the freezer until hardened. Again, the fridge will work, but it will take longer.
5. Slice into squares of desired size and enjoy! They'll probably be too hard to cut right out of the freezer so you may need to let them thaw a bit first.
6. Store in the refrigerator
