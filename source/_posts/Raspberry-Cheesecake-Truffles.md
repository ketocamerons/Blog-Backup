# Ingredients
- 8 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 1/2 cup powdered Swerve or erythritol or other sugar substitute
- 2 tablespoons heavy cream
- 1 teaspoon vanilla stevia
- pinch salt
- 3 teaspoons raspberry extract ( I used McCormick)
- few drops of natural red food coloring
- 1/4 cup coconut oil, melted
- 1 1/2 cup sugar free chocolate chips/chocolate, melted

# Instructions
1. In a stand mixer blend the cream cheese and Swerve together until smooth.
2. Add the cream, stevia, salt and raspberry extract, natural food coloring until combined well.
3. Slowly add in the coconut oil and continue to blend on high until it's incorporated.
4. Scrape down the edges of the bowl to make sure it's all mixed well.
5. Refrigerate this mixture for 1 hour.
6. Using a 1 1/4 inch mini cookie scoop, scoop batter into a parchment lined baking sheet. This should make 48 balls.
7. Freeze these for 1 hour before coating with melted chocolate.
8. Drop one cheesecake truffle into melted chocolate at a time and place bake on lined pan.
9. Refrigerate for another hour. The truffles must be kept refrigerated until ready to serve.
