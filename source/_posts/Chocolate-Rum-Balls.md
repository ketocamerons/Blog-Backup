# Instructions
Mix all the ingredients together into a bowl. Combine until sticky. Depending on the weather, if it gets to sloppy, just add some more almond flour to the mix.

Roll into balls and roll in some extra shredded coconut. (I blended my shredded coconut in the nutri-bullet so it was smaller shreds). Let the disco overwhelm you as you point to the sky, then point to the floor whilst making these ones!
Refrigerate on a plate and enjoy!
