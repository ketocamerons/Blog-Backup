This one does have a few more ingredients than I usually muck around with, but it is worth it if you're a gingerbread nut like me. The original recipe can be found [here](https://alldayidreamaboutfood.com/classic-gingerbread-men-low-carb-and-gluten-free/), although I don't always make a whole batch (which makes ~50 cookies)!

# Instructions
1. For the cookies, preheat oven to 275F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together almond flour, sweetener, coconut flour, ginger, cinnamon, baking powder, xanthan gum, salt and cloves.
3. Stir in eggs, coconut oil, molasses and vanilla extract until dough comes together.
4. Divide dough in half and turn out first half onto a large piece of parchment paper. Top with another piece of parchment and roll out out about 1/4 inch thick.
5. Use cookie cutters to cut into desired shapes and gently loosen and lift with an offset spatula. Place onto prepared baking sheets.k
6. Gather up scraps and reroll until too little is left to roll out. Repeat with second half of dough.
7. Bake 20 minutes or until golden brown and just firm to the touch. Remove and let cool 5 minutes on pan, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
8. For the royal icing, in a medium bowl, whisk together powdered sweetener, meringue powder and arrowroot starch or xanthan gum.
9. Add water and stir until smooth. Add more water 1 teaspoon at a time until desired consistency is achieved.
10. Pipe icing onto cooled cookies and let set 30 minutes or longer.

## Note
For crisper cookies, bake at 225F for 50 to 60 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool. They will crisp up as they cool
