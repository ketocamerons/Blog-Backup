I was a little skeptical of this recipe at first, but it was easy to make, tastes great, and keeps well. It pairs well with some greek yoghurt or cream for a quick dessert, or just munch on it as a snack. The original recipe can be found [here](https://www.sugarfreemom.com/recipes/crock-pot-grain-free-low-carb-sugar-free-granola/).
