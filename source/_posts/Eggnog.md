This is a delicious, filling, dessert-y drink which should not just be relegated to Christmas time. This is one of my favorite easy versions, and the original recipe can be found [here](https://www.ketoconnect.net/recipe/keto-eggnog/).

# Ingredients
- 2 large eggs

# Instructions
1. Separate the eggs into two medium bowls, and set the egg whites aside.
2. Using a whisk beat the yolks until they turn light yellow in color. Once the color has lightened add 2tsp of the sweetener and mix again.
3. Add the heavy whipping cream, flax milk, and nut meg to the yolk mixture and whisk to combine. Set aside.
4. Using a hand mixer whisk the egg whites until you get soft peaks. Add the remaining tsp of swerve and whisk until you get medium peaks.
5. Add the whites to yolk mixture and whisk together briefly until fully combined. Chill for 3-4 hours.
6. Once chilled the mixture will separate slightly so give it another whisk prior to serving. Garnish with additional nutmeg, if desired.
