# Instructions
1. Mix the softened butter with the coconut flour, baking powder salt, pepper and chilli (optional) until smooth.
2. Add the eggs one at a time. Stir after each egg is added.
3. Gently stir through the sliced spring onion and grated/shredded cheese (reserve some to top each loaf).
4. Fill each mini loaf tin (or muffin cases). 
I like to top my mini loaves with a few pepperoni stick slices, then cover with some grated/shredded cheese and finally sprinkle a few pumpkin seeds over.
5. Bake at 180C/350F for 15 minutes, or until golden.
