Zucchini used to be a veggie I tolerated, but this recipe has made me crave it! (Or maybe just the cheese...). The original recipe can be found [here](https://www.ibreatheimhungry.com/easy-cheesy-zucchini-gratin-low-carb-keto/).

# Ingredients
- 4 cups sliced raw zucchini
- 1 small onion, peeled and sliced thin
- salt and pepper to taste
- 1 1/2 cups shredded pepper jack cheese
- 2 Tbsp butter
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream

---

# Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375 F ().
2. Grease a 9x9 or equivalent oven proof pan.
3. Overlap 1/3 of the zucchini and onion slices in the pan, then season with salt and pepper and sprinkle with Â½ cup of shredded cheese.
4. Repeat two more times until you have three layers and have used up all of the zucchini, onions, and shredded cheese.
5. Combine the garlic powder, butter, and heavy cream in a microwave safe dish.
6. Heat for one minute or until the butter has melted. Stir.
7. Gently pour the butter and cream mixture over the zucchini layers.
8. Bake at 375 degrees (F) for about 45 minutes, or until the liquid has thickened and the top is golden brown. Serve warm.

### Notes
- Depending on your zucchini, you may find it takes longer to cook in order to get your sauce to reduce. If you find it very watery after the 45 minutes, lower the oven temp to 350 and cook it another 10 minutes or so.
