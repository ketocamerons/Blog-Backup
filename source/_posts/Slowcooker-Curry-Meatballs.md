I really like using Ikea veggie meatballs for this recipe, which makes it great for vegetarians. It's also dairy-free, and the original recipe can be found [here](https://www.yummly.com/recipe/Slow-Cooker-Red-Curry-Meatballs-2365167?prm-v1&utm_medium=email&utm_source=seasonal&utm_campaign=Crockpot_Curries).
