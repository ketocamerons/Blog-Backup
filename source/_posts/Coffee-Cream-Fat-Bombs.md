# Ingredients (makes 20 servings):
- 1 cup creamed coconut milk or mascarpone cheese or full-fat cream cheese (250 g / 8.8 oz)
- 1/4 cup butter, grass-fed or extra virgin coconut oil (56 g / 2 oz)
- 2 tbsp MCT oil or more coconut oil
- 2 tbsp raw cocoa powder, unsweetened
- 1/4 cup Erythritol or Swerve(40 g / 1.4 oz)
- 10-15 drops liquid Stevia extract (I skip this, add if you want extra sweetness)
- 1/2 cup strong brewed coffee or caffeine-free chicory coffee (120 ml / 4 fl oz)
- Optionally: 1 tsp rum extract

# Instructions
1. Place the softened creamed coconut milk (or mascarpone cheese), butter or coconut oil, MCT oil and cocoa powder.
2. Add powdered Erythritol and stevia into a blender and pulse until smooth. 
3. Pour in the prepared coffee (room temperature or lukewarm, not hot) and pulse again until smooth. 
4. Pour into the into the ice-cream maker and process according to the manufacturer's instructions. 
*Tips when you don't have an ice-cream maker: Pour the mixture directly into an ice tray or small muffin tin. You should be able to fit ~ 2 tablespoons per fat bomb or make smaller fat bombs. You can also use 1-2 teaspoons instant coffee powder instead of Â½ cup of coffee. The mixture will be thicker and you won't need an ice-cream maker.*
5. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the ice-cream into ice tray or other mould. 
6. Place in the freezer for 2-3 hours or until firm.
