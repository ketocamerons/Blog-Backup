# Instructions
1. Combine all the dry ingredients in a blender or food processor. Set aside.
2. Combine butter, stevia and extract into a bowl and combine using a hand mixer. Add the eggs and combine again.
3. In two parts add the dry to the wet ingredients as you combine with the hand mixture.
4. Using a cookie scooper or spoon make 16 cookies, placing them onto a baking sheet with parchment paper. Flatten them out before putting them in the even as thin as you'd like because they will not spread in the oven.
5. Place the cookies in a 350 degree oven for 25-28 minutes. Oven temps vary so keep an eye on them!
6. Allow to cool on a baking rack. Enjoy!
