I'm honestly not sure if I've tested this recipe, but with Christmas coming up I certainly will. The original recipe can be found [here](https://www.ibreatheimhungry.com/lemon-almond-shortbread-cookies-low-carb-gluten-free/). It reportedly can also be used as a tart base, making 1 large tart base or 16 cookies.

# Ingredients
- 6 Tbl butter
- 2 cups almond flour
- 1/3 cup granulated sweetener (Splenda, Ideal, Swerve, etc.)
- 1 tsp freshly grated lemon zest


---

# Instructions
1. Melt the butter in the microwave or a small saucepan. 
2. Add the almond flour, sweetener, and lemon zest, stirring until fully combined.

## To make a tart or pie crust:
3. No need to pre-chill, just press dough into tart or pie tins. 
4. Bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees (F) for 15 mins until firm and golden brown.

## To make the cookies:
3. Form dough (it will be crumbly, this is normal) into a cylinder and wrap tightly with plastic wrap to compress. Chill in freezer for 30 minutes or until firm, or in the refrigerator for 2 hours. With a sharp knife, slice into ½ inch thick cookies (if they crumble apart your dough isn't cold enough). 
4. Bake in a preheated oven @ 350 degrees (F) on a greased or parchment lined cookie sheet for 15 minutes, or until firm and golden brown. Allow to cool before removing.
