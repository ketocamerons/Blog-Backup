This is a recipe I've tried a few times (although I couldn't find the exact recipe) when having lactose-free friends over, and it would also be great for vegos or vegans. It goes down well, and I don't even miss the dairy (or eggs!) The original recipe can be found [here](https://cafedelites.com/3-ingredient-double-chocolate-mousse-low-carb/).

# Ingredients
- 2 x 400ml (13.7oz) cans full fat coconut cream or coconut milk *See Notes
- 2 tablespoons confectioners sweetener 
- 3 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
- pinch of salt (optional)
- 20 g | 2 squares 70% chocolate , shaved (optional for extra richness -- or sugar free chocolate chips)
- extra shaved chocolate to garnish

# Instructions
1. Place sealed cans of coconut cream (or milk) in the refrigerator overnight. 
2. Without shaking the cans, open and scoop out the thick cream sitting at the top over the water. Transfer the cream to a bowl and discard the liquid left in the cans.
3. Add the sweetener (or sugar) and beat on high using a hand mixer (or whisk) until thick and creamy (about 1-2 minutes). Reserve about 4 tablespoons of the plain 'whipped cream' to use as a topping to serve with (optional), and set aside.
4. Fold the cocoa powder and salt through the cream and beat (or whisk) again until smooth, well combined and thick. 
5. Fold through the shaved chocolate. Depending on the coconut milk you use, a mousse will form almost immediately once the cocoa powder is mixed through. If not, refrigerate until set and ready to serve, or serve immediately. 
6. Dollop the 'plain whipped cream' over the mousse and sprinkle with shaved chocolate (if using).


### Notes
*I found coconut cream worked the best, but you can use coconut milk. Do not try to use light or reduced fat. You need the fat content in both the cream and/or milk to make the cream successfully or it may not work.
